ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication, behavior and social interaction deficits in patients which may include repetitive behavior, 
irritability, and attention problems.
AI will transform the lives of people with ASD.







Through this application, we want to facilitate the communication of children with autism and to better understand their feelings and experiences.
We want to build a chatbot with real time face emotion recognition through AI in Python, so that it is easier to follow the reactions and responses of the child with ASD.
Also, the communication of the affected child with the chatbot can be done in 2 ways: by writing or through speech recognition. By speech recognition we want to improve the speech of the child with autism but there is also the possibility to use the keyboard 
to communicate with the chatbot.
We have included in this application a sum game called "Guess the Word" through which we want to track the user's reactions to different words in various categories. If he guesses the word, he will receive 5 points each.
By making available at this time the following categories of words: animals, body parts, colors, fruits, shapes, vegetables, vehicles we want to extend these with certain events in children's lives that made them feel good like birthday cake, gifts.
