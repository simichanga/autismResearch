A condition that needs a lot of care, autism is largely misunderstood, especially at a young age. 
It makes it difficult to communicate, thus dissociating people with ASD from the outside world.
Their imagination is captive with no way to be expressed, having difficulties in developing
an understanding of spoken language so they resort to nonverbal communication. This is often
misunderstood, slowly developing and accumulating frustration that will eventually be released
in an unhealthy manner, fact that causes rigidity in social interactions.




ASDs have a negative effect on children's developing education,
their goals and strategies to accomplish them.


This research paper aims to study patterns in cognitive behavior of people with ASD to see if we can facilitate them with better means of education through Game Theory.
