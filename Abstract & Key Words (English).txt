Abstract:
A condition that needs a lot of care, autism is largely misunderstood, especially at a young age. 
Imagination of children with ASDs is captive with no way to be expressed, having difficulties in developing
an understanding of spoken language so they resort to nonverbal communication. 


In this field of study there are limited resources dedicated to autism, especially for children,
that's why we're aiming with this research paper to study patterns in cognitive behavior of people
with ASD to see if we can facilitate them with better means of education through Game Theory.
To support the research we implemented neural networks to see if/ how much people with ASDs can benefit
from such an approach. By developing a program like this we want to also help medical professionals with 
a better understanding of them. Besides this, the program can help in improving their communication skills 
and find a better way to communicate ideas and emotions.



Key Words:
